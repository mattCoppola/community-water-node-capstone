# community-water-node-capstone

## Project Description
This website provides the user with resources to learn about the health impacts of lead in water.  Additionally, it's a website for a user to access their local government's website to order a water testing kit.  After testing water they are able to create a login and enter their results.  The results will become part of a community database that shares resident information with the local government providing them with relevant data to take action in areas of concern.
